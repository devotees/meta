# Scope

This agreement covers source code, designs, scripts, documentation, names, marks, and tests which comprise a service for collecting, storing, retrieving, and analyzing hyperlinks and the documents they represent. (hereafter, "the system")

# Parties

The parties to this agreement are Ryan Prior and Saul Pwanson (hereafter, "the parties").

# Eligibility

The parties represent that no agreement or contract with any other party, such as an employer, restrains them from entering into this agreement.

# Responsibility to contribute

The parties acknowledge a shared responsibility to contribute time and/or capital to the improveemnt of the system and promotion of its usefulness.

The parties will meet monthly to agree upon a mutually acceptable level of contribution at that time. At this meeting the parties will determine:
   - the number of hours of work
   - tasks to be performed by each party
   - the amount and method of payments to be made

The parties agree to maintain a digital record of these agreements.

# Equity

The parties agree that any activity which derives significant revenue using the system constitutes commercialization of the system.

Whereas either of the parties may be interested in commercializing the system, and whereas the parties have each invested work equity and/or capital equity in the creation of the system, therefore the parties agree that upon forming an entity (including, but not limited to, an LLC, C-corp, or 501(c)(3) corp) to commercialize the system they will grant the other party a 25% equity stake in that entity.

The parties agree not to commercialize the system without the formation of such an entity and grant of equity.

# Sales of property or rights

The parties agree to give the other party the right of first refusal on any sale of property or rights relative to the system. The parties agree to make no such sale to an outside entity (the "buyer") unless the buyer agrees to be bound by the equity terms of this agreement (under the subheading "Equity" above).

# Enforceability

If any portion or provision of this agreement (including, without limitation, any portion or provision of any section of this agreement) shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

# Termination

Either party can terminate this agreement at any time. The terminating party agrees to transfer any remaining rights and property related to the system to the other party.
